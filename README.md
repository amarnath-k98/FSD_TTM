---

## 📘 Project Overview

**Team Task Manager** is a full-stack web application designed for small to mid-sized teams to manage tasks efficiently. It supports role-based access control (RBAC), email notifications, and task assignment workflows with full CRUD operations.

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Simple but powerful UI for managing tasks
* Role-based permission system (Admin, Manager, Employee, Viewer)
* Email notifications for onboarding and task assignment
* Scalable backend with RESTful APIs
* Frontend using React + Redux + React Router
